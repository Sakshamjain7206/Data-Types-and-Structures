        "Ans-Mutable data types can be modified after creation, meaning their values can change in place. Examples include lists (my_list[0] = 10) and dictionaries (my_dict[\"key\"] = \"value\"), which allow updates without creating new objects.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans- Lists and tuples in Python are both used to store collections of items, but they have several key differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Mutability**: Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed or modified after creation. In contrast, tuples are immutable, so their contents cannot be altered once defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Syntax**: Lists are created using square brackets ([ ]), while tuples use parentheses (( )).\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans-Dictionaries in Python store data as **key-value pairs** in a highly efficient and organized manner using **hashing**. Here's how they work:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Key-Value Structure**:  \n",
        "   Each entry in a dictionary has a unique key associated with a value. Keys must be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples), while values can be of any data type.\n",
        "\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Hashing**:  \n",
        "   Keys are hashed using a hash function to generate a unique hash code, which determines where the key-value pair is stored in memory. This ensures quick access.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Fast Lookup**:  \n",
        "   Using the hash code, dictionaries provide constant-time complexity, O(1), for retrieving, updating, or deleting values based on their keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Collision Handling**:  \n",
        "   If two keys produce the same hash code (a collision), Python uses techniques like **open addressing** or **chaining** to resolve conflicts and store the data.\n",

It uses a **hash function** to map keys to specific locations in an array, allowing fast access to values. Python **dictionaries** are built using hash tables. When you use a dictionary, Python automatically hashes the keys to find the correct spot in memory to store the value. This makes dictionary operations like looking up, adding, or deleting items very fast."

        "\n",
        "1. **Order Matters**:\n",
        "   - If the order of elements is important (e.g., maintaining a sequence), a list is better because it preserves the order in which elements are added.\n",
        "   - Example: A list of tasks in the order they need to be completed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Indexed by Position**:\n",
        "   - When you want to access elements by their position (index), lists are ideal.\n",
        "   - Example: Accessing the 3rd element in a list using `my_list[2]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **No Need for Unique Keys**:\n",
        "   - Lists are good when you don’t need unique identifiers (keys) for each element.\n",
        "   - Example: A list of names where duplicates are allowed, such as `[\"Anu\", \"Ben\", \"Ajay\"]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Homogeneous Data**:\n",
        "   - If the data is similar or the same type and can be stored in a simple, ordered collection, a list is simpler to use.\n",
        "   - Example: A list of numbers or strings.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **List**:\n",
        "   - You retrieve data from a list using an **index** (position), which is a number representing the element's position in the list.\n",
        "   - **Order matters**: Lists preserve the order of elements, so the index determines which element you get.\n",
        "   - **Slower search**: To find an element, Python may have to go through the list until it finds the value (linear search), which takes more time if the list is large.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dictionary**:\n",
        "   - You retrieve data from a dictionary using a **key**, not an index. A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs.\n",
        "   - **Order doesn’t matter** (though Python 3.7+ remembers the order of insertion, this is secondary to retrieval speed).\n",
        "   - **Faster search**: Dictionaries use **hashing**, so Python can quickly find the value associated with the key (constant time, O(1)).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Difference:\n",
